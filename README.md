<h2>An introduction to the repository</h2>
<p>This respository covers all the basics and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) of Python programming language. The reason why i created this repository besides that i do not want to lose all of my folders is because: i just want to share to public of my Python studying journey. Because for me studying deserves to be exhibited (note that do not be exaggerated when exhibit something) so that our family and friends can see our studying journey.</p>
