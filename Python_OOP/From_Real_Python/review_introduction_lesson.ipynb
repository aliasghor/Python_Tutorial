Whereas a class only specify that a certain attributes must be fulfilled, but it doesn't contain an attributes of any spesific instance."

    "- `def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, hobby: str) -> None`: `__init__()` magic method (dunder method) is used to declare which attributes each instance of the class should have. To put it simply `__init__()` magic method is used to assign an attribute value of each instances **implicitly** through the `self` parameter. `self` parameter is special parameter (although it is not necessary to use `self`, but it would be better if we followed the conventation.), because everytime we instantiate a class (create an object) Python will automatically passes the instance to the `self` parameter, so that Python can create and assign each attributes value **implicitly**.\n",

    "- `def greet(self, other_person)`: This is what it is called an instance method, an instance method is used to make a behavior of what the instance can do. In this case this instance method has a behaviour to greet another instance object's name. `self` is a mandatory parameter when it comes to instance method, because we want to have an interaction between objects. The `self` parameter refers to an actual instance, whereas other person refers to another instance.\n",

Therefore to return a string representation of an object, we'll need to create the `self` parameter variable; Python automatically passes the instance to the `self` parameter variable.\n",
