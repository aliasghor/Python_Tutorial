    "according to: [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/#what-is-object-oriented-programming-in-python), Object-Oriented Programming (also known and abbreviated as OOP) is programming paradigm that provide a means to structuring programs so that properties (attributes) and behaviours (methods) are bundled into individual objects. Or in my own opinion an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where we group every attributes and methods together into an objects."

An instance is neither a class nor blueprint anymore, because an instance contains a real data from the class. Whereas a class doesn't contain any spesific data's (attributes) to each objects; it actually emphasizes that a certain data (attribute) must be filled.\n",

Therefore, Python can automatically passes and assigns each instance attributes through the `self` parameter.  "
