    "- **Instance methods**: Instance methods are methods **that is belong/attached to the object**. Instance methods always takes the first parameter as `self` which points to an instance when the method is called. Through the `self` parameter instance methods can freely access attributes, methods, initalize an attribute values, change an attribute values. Not only that, an instance can also access a class attribute.\n",

    "- **Class methods**: Class methods are methods **that is belong/attached to the class**. Class methods always takes the first parameter as `cls` that points to a class and not the object instance when the method is called. Therefore it cannot modify nor access instance attributes, methods, but it can modify the class attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static methods**: Static methods are methods *That is belong/attached to the class*. Unlike class methods, static methods takes neither `self` (the object instance) or `cls` (the class) parameter. Therefore a static methods can neither modify nor access object/class attributes and methods. Static methods behaves the same like reguler functions, but only belongs to the class it self; It acts like a helper functions."
