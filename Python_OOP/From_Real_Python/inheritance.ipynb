    "# Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in which a class inherits/derives an attributes or methods from the based class (parent-class/superclass) to derived class (child-class/subclass) without needing them to implement it again. In short the purpose of inheritance is to reduce the amount of **code** and **repeated** codes by inheriting an attributes or methods from the based class (parent-class/superclass)."
