    "An Object-Oriented Programming or also known and abbreviated as OOP, is a Programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which can contain attributes and methods. In short OOP is where we group all of our data and functions together under one name and it is the class name. A class is like a blueprint it is used to create a new type of object/instance and an object/instance is the variable name from that class name."
