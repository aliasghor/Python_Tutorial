    "To simplify the amount of previous code it would be better for us to have a constructor. A constructor is a method that will be called first when we instantiating a class, in Python there is a called dunder (double under score) method that will be called first when we instantiating an object and that dunder method is called __init__() method. An __init__() method is used to initialize instance/object values and the first parameter variable name will be always called self. When we instantiating a class Python automatically passes the instance/object to the self parameter to define a new attributes to each instances/objects. So in essence self parameter variable is a must, without it we cannot instancied a class nor define a new attributes to each instances/objects."
