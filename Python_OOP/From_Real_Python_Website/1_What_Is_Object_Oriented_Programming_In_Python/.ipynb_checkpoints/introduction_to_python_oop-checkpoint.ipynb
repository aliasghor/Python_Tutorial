    "An Object-Oriented Programming or also known and abbreviated as OOP, is a Programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which can contain attributes and methods. In short OOP is where we group all of our data and functions together under one name and it is the class name. A class is a blueprint that is used to create a new type of object/instance and an object/instance is the variable name from that class name."

The init method is the first method that will be called when we instantiating a class, and __init__() method is used to initalize every instances/objects value. In addition the first parameter of __init__() method should be self, the reason is because everytime when we instantiating a class Python automatically passes the instance/object to the self parameter so that Python can define the new attributes to each instances/objects."
